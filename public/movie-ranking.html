 <h1>My Best Movies</h1>
 <h2>Top Three Movies Right Now</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>Suzume</h3>
 <p>This movie was visually stunning! It was a beautiful story and the plot kept me on the edge of my seat.</p>
 <h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
 <p>What I loved most about this movie was the music and the sound design. The sound was crisp and almost tactile. It was an immersive experience.</p>
 <h3>Rango</h3>
 <p>The style of animation of this film was completely unexpected. I had never seen anything else like it! I loved Johnny Depp's performance as Rango
    in this movie. I was rooting for him the entire time. I like how Rango learned valuable lessons and showed growth. It reminded me of how we are all 
    trying to figure out who we are and what matters to us.</p>
