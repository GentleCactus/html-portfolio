<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Angel. I grew up in Utah and have lived here my whole life. Most of my work experience has been in public education.
   I began as a guitar teacher for an elementary school afterschool program, and went on to fill many different roles as a 
   paraprofessional in the school, as a teacher's aid, and as the computer lab instructor. I currently work at a warehouse driving forklifts.</p>
<p>I love phá»Ÿ. I love ceviche. I love avocados.</p>

<p>I'm a fan of anime! Some of my favorite series are 
  <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y469u6r4">Jujutsu Kaisen</a>, 
  <a href="https://tinyurl.com/3udjjruc">Mob Psycho 100</a>, and 
  <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yyf5yr6w">Mushi-Shi</a>.</p>

<p>I have aspirations as a software engineer and I'm interested and in how technology intersects with our understanding of reality. I want
   to learn how technology blends with our psychology and how it takes ancient indigenous practices like curanderismo into contemporary 
   understanding and praxis of spirituality, and how technologies like virtual reality mirror dream states and experiences with 
   psychedelics in indigenous healing ceremonies.</p>

<p>I want to reimagine what technological advancement looks like, while also preserving ancestral wisdom and culture.</p>
